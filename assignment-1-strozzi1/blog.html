    <li>Assignment 1: March 7th, 2018</li>
        <ul>
            <li>I didn't really face many challenges. This is a simple assignment. Maybe here and there I forgot syntax, but a quick internet search solved all issues.</li>
            <li>I don't think I learned anything. This is all very basic syntax, which is nice. I remember it from my crappy web dev class at highschool.</li>
            <li>The most useful resource for this has been <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3school.com</a>. All I gotta do is look up an element or attribute, and it has examples for all!</li>
